We start early to reach the south of Manhattan and embark on a ferry to Liberty Island. There the Statue of Liberty is waiting for us. We learn about her origins and how she was created and built in Paris, France before being shipped to America in 1884. We also discover her true name : 'Liberty Enlightening the World'. It's an amazing work of art to say the least.
We return to Timesquare and grab a bite at New York's famous Joe's Pizza. Then we try the Top of The Rock attraction but learn we have to come back later, so we book our tickets for wednesday's sunset.
Then it was time for us to head to the major event of our trip : the NBA game between the New yOrk Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets. The Madison Square is absolutely impressive from inside. They definitely know how to entertain! The game is great and fileld with some awsesome basketball moments. The Knicks come out victorious but congratulations to both teams who gave us a show to remember!
