After weeks of preparation, waiting, developping the website and last minute packing, we fianlly make it to... freezing but sunny Iceland!<br>
This was only a short stop before our final destination : New York City!<br>
Then from Newark airport straight to the YMCA hotel in Harlem, our new home for the next few days.<br>
Despite the late hour and our tiredness after one of the less comfortable flight we've ever had we dedcide to check the area for food. We find a nice senegalese restaurant and Tristan tries out shawarma for the first time and loves it!<br>
Quick drink at a local bar 'The Shrine' and we're off to bed.<br>
We get some rest and wake up with the rain that won't stop all day. We learn how the New York subway system works, and we learn it the hard way : there is a difference between local and express trains, one stops everywhere the other not so much!<br>
The American Museum of Natural History is closed for the day so there is not much to do but check out the Macy's and Century 21 stores for clothes.<br>
We end the day by grabbing some food (and only the food!) at the famous Hooters sports bar and watch the Venom movie at a nearby cinema (which Jon must have found boring as he slept through most of it!).
